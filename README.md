This project reproduces the paper Predicting Drug Sensitivity of Cancer Cell Lines via Collaborative Filtering with Contextual Attention by Yifeng Tao, Shuangxia Ren, Michael Q. Ding, Russell Schwartz, and Xinghua Lu

We successfully reproduced the CADRE (Contextual Attention-based Drug REsponse) model proposed by Tao et al. (2020) for predicting cancer cell line sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Using the GDSC dataset, we conducted extensive training experiments with different iterations across multiple runs. Our penultimate attempt with 73,652 iterations achieved close but suboptimal results (test AUC: 82.5%, 98.9% of the paper's 83.4%). We then trained for 147,628 iterations and achieved a test AUC of 83.8%, representing 100.5% of the paper's reported performance, successfully matching and exceeding the original results. Additionally, we conducted an extension, a comparison demonstrating CADRE's 21.2% AUC improvement over logistic regression. Our analysis reveals rapid early learning, with most performance gains occurring within the first 30,000 iterations and a performance plateau after 75,000 iterations, confirming the model's computational efficiency.
